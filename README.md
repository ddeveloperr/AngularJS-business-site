### AngularJS-business-site : [See demo] (http://ddeveloperr.github.io/AngularJS_1_business-site/#/contact)
================================

Business case:
A local company XYZ has asked me to build a new www.simpleinc.io web site. The basic areas will be:

Pages: 

Home | 
Services |
Pricing |
About |
FAQ |
Contact

Blog:

Action:
To skip over the construction of a basic static website, I implemented a free website theme based on Bootstrap.
For this example I used, http://startbootstrap.com/modern-business, HTML5 Boilerplate (which implements superior site wide practices) and combined all into a simple and fast AngularJS app! 

That was the chalenge what I'd build it following [tutorial guides](https://www.airpair.com/angularjs/building-angularjs-app-tutorial#5-what-exactly-is-angularjs-) and rebuilt my own solution succesfully in seven effective hours! 

Clone it, hack it, play and learn from code.
